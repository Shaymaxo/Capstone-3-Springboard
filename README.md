# Customer Churn Analysis: Predictive Modeling for Retention Strategy

An end-to-end capstone project using interpretable machine learning and interactive dashboards to identify key drivers of churn and power proactive retention in subscription-based telecom services.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

Subscription businesses spend up to 5√ó more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. This project turns churn prediction from a reactive challenge into a strategic advantage by:

- Diagnosing the root causes of churn across demographics, service usage, and payment behaviors  
- Building two complementary models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) with clear business-ready outputs  
- Packaging insights into an interactive Tableau dashboard for real-time risk monitoring  

Key impact metrics:

- Logistic Regression AUC: **0.836**, Recall: **91.0%**  
- Contract terms drive **80%** of predictive power  
- Month-to-month fiber customers on electronic checks churn at **45‚Äì50%**  

---

## üìä Problem Statement & Business Context

Subscription churn silently erodes revenue. Traditional retention tactics often:

- Over-spend on low-risk groups  
- Overlook high-risk segments  
- React to cancellations instead of preventing them  

A data-driven approach can recover millions in revenue by shifting to proactive, targeted retention campaigns.

## üìà Data Overview & Methodology

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)  
- 7,043 customer records, 21 features  
- Demographics, services (internet, streaming), account info (contracts, payments), financials (tenure, charges)  

Workflow:

1. Data cleaning & feature engineering (tenure buckets, dummy encoding)  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (family ties, age, payment methods, tenure pricing paradox)  
3. Model development (Logistic Regression for interpretability, Decision Tree for non-linear insights)  
4. Performance evaluation focused on business metrics (AUC, recall, precision)  
5. Insight packaging via interactive Tableau dashboard  

Tools & Tech: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau Public

## üîç Key Findings: Customer Behavior

- **Family Structure**  
  - No partner/no dependents churn at **34.2%**  
  - Partner + dependents churn at **14.2%**  
- **Age**  
  - Seniors churn at **42%** vs **24%** for non-seniors  
- **Payment Method**  
  - Electronic checks: **45.3%** churn  
  - Automatic payments: **15‚Äì17%** churn  
- **Tenure & Pricing**  
  - Loyal customers pay more: \$56.17/mo (0‚Äì12 mo) ‚Üí \$75.95/mo (61+ mo)  
- **Contract Terms**  
  - Month-to-month: **31.5‚Äì48.3%** churn  
  - One-year: **7.1‚Äì14.8%** churn  
  - Two-year: **1.6‚Äì4.2%** churn  
- **Paperless Billing Paradox**  
  - Paperless users churn **1.5√ó** more than paper statement users  
- **Service Quality Flag**  
  - Fiber internet customers churn disproportionately, signaling quality or expectation gaps

## ü§ñ Predictive Modeling & Performance

| Model                 | AUC   | Precision | Recall  | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.836 | 0.504     | 0.910   | 0.739    |
| Decision Tree         | 0.798 | 0.426     | 0.929   | 0.653    |

- Logistic Regression offers clear coefficient insights and risk-tier scoring  
- Decision Tree excels at recall but incurs more false positives  

### Feature Importance (Logistic Regression)

| Feature               | Importance (%) |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Two-year contract     | 49.2           |
| One-year contract     | 30.8           |
| Fiber internet        | 13.5           |
| Streaming movies      | 4.1            |
| Total charges         | 1.2            |

## üìä Interactive Dashboard

A Tableau Public dashboard allows dynamic filtering by churn score, tenure, contract, and payment to:

- Identify the highest-risk cohort: month-to-month fiber customers on e-checks (< 12 mo tenure)  
- Drill into senior, family-tie, and paperless billing segments  

PDF export included for quick sharing.
